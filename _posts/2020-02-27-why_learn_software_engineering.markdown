To start this off i'd like to provide a quote from one of the greatest creative minds of our lifetime.

>"Everyone should learn how to code, it teaches you how to think." ~Steve Jobs

I think this is completely true. Software Engineering helps you break down problems, and create solutions for those problems. As an entreprenuer, problem solving is one of the most important skills you can posses. Not only does Software Engineering help you think, it helps you get comfortable with failing. Failure is not the end. You should never be afraid to fail. Being afraid to fail is arguably one of the worst mindsets you can have. True winners use failure to spur them. Failure makes you stronger. Failure makes you better. Failure makes you smarter. I'm glad i can start this journey with all of you.
